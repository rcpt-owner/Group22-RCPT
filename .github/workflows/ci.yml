# NOTE:
# Removed previous docker-build job because it referenced a non-existent Dockerfile ("Dockerfile")
# and current frontend Dockerfile expects a 'rcpt/' subfolder which is not present in repository layout.
# Reintroduce a Docker build job after aligning Dockerfile COPY paths with actual structure.
