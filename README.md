# Research Pricing and Costing Tool (RPCT) - Group22

## ðŸš¦ Project status â€” Stable release (with caveats)
This repository is now published as a stable development release suitable for evaluation and internal use. Many core features are implemented and the application can be used end-to-end in typical scenarios.

Known limitations in this release:
- Caching and some session snapshot behaviour is intentionally minimal or incomplete (see Frontend notes).
- Some resources are still loaded from mock JSON (public/api) rather than the backend for a few form schemas and lookups.
- Staff cost calculation is implemented as a basic summation and does not yet include full business logic (on-costs, rates, complex FTE handling) â€” treat pricing figures as provisional.
- The backend integration points exist but several API paths remain to be wired/verified in production (see Backend service TODOs below).

Continue to use this branch for stable development; breakages should be rare but please review the "Known limitations" when evaluating outputs.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview
The RPCT replaces a legacy Excel-based costing/pricing workbook used for preparing research project budgets.  
Core goals remain: accurate costing, flexible pricing, scenario comparisons, simplified export and review workflows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Accurate research project costing (personnel, nonâ€‘personnel, indirects/overheads)
- Flexible pricing (margins, markâ€‘ups, cost recovery policies)
- Scenario comparison and version control
- Structured approval workflow (applicant â†’ faculty/RIC review â†’ finalisation)
- Role-based access and audit logging
- Export (Excel/PDF/JSON) for submissions and internal reporting
- Accessibility, usability, and reduced error risk
- Foundation for future integrations (HR, finance, grants)

## ðŸ‘¤ Target Users & Stakeholders
Primary:
- Researchers / Grant Applicants
- RIC Administration & Pricing Officers

Secondary / Consulted:
- Faculty research managers
- Finance (overhead rules, rate tables)
- IT / Infrastructure (hosting, SSO)
- Compliance / Governance
- Executive stakeholders (reporting requirements)

## âœ¨ Key Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Dynamic project form (modular schema-driven fields)
- Personnel & non-personnel cost entry
- Automated indirect cost & onâ€‘cost calculations
- Pricing adjustments (margin, recovery policies)
- Scenario/version management
- Approval & status workflow
- Audit trail (who changed what/when)
- Validation & contextual guidance
- Export: PDF, Excel, machine-readable JSON
- Reporting snapshots (summary, line-item costing)
- Role-based access & permissions
- Notifications (pending approvals, changes requested)
- Reference data / lookup management
- Basic dashboard (recent projects, status indicators)

## ðŸ§° Development Setup
(Note: early stage; commands will change.)

1. Clone:  
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/maxChiv/Group22-RCPT.git  
   cd Group22-RCPT
   ```
2. Switch to main or dev branch:  
   ``` git checkout main ```
3. Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript):  
    ```
   cd Frontend  
   npm install  
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Backend (Spring Boot):  
   ``` 
   cd ../Backend  
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

Docker (optional):
```bash
# from repo root
docker compose up --build frontend
```

Dependencies, environment variables, and Docker images are provisional and will be formalised when architecture stabilises.

## Stability & Known Limitations (details)
- Caching: The frontend rcptEngine/rcptCache provides a local snapshot mechanism. Some cache behaviours and TTLs are conservative and certain forms still prefer runtime mock merges. Expect improvements in subsequent releases.
- Backend loading: Several form schemas and lookup sets are served from public/api during development. When integrating with production backend, update BASE_URL / VITE_API_BASE_URL and confirm endpoints in src/services/*.
- Staff cost calculation: Current engine does basic per-year aggregation. It does not yet apply institutional rates, on-costs, fringe, or advanced FTE conversion rules. Validate outputs before downstream use.
- Tests & CI: Coverage is limited; more unit/integration tests will be added for the costing and pricing logic.

## ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s in this repo (key references)
- Frontend app: Frontend/ â€” React + TypeScript + Vite
  - Frontend README: Frontend/README.md
  - Dynamic Forms guide: Frontend/src/components/forms/README.md
  - Dockerfile for frontend: Docker/frontend.Dockerfile
- Backend services: Backend/ â€” Spring Boot APIs (domain + controllers)
- Docs & infra: Docker/README.md, CI and config files

Important files (frontend):
- Frontend/src/components/forms/DynamicForm.tsx â€” JSON-driven form renderer
- Frontend/src/utils/zodSchemaBuilder.ts â€” runtime Zod builder for form validation
- Frontend/src/features/RCPT/rcptEngine.ts â€” local engine, persistence mirrors and simple totals
- Frontend/public/api â€” mock form JSON used in development

## Roadmap (high level)
- Stabilise server-side schema endpoints (swap mock JSON for API)
- Complete caching behaviour and TTL semantics
- Implement full staff cost calculation rules (on-costs, graded rates, time-basis conversions)
- Add more tests around pricing engine and exports
- Harden CI and release process

## How to help / contribute
- Report issues with precise repro steps and expected behaviour
- Add unit tests for rcptEngine totals and zod schema builder
- Replace mock forms in public/api with backend endpoints and update optionsUrl usages
- Implement missing staff cost business rules in Backend and reflect in Frontend totals
